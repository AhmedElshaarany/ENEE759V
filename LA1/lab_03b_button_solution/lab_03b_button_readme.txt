lab_03b_button

The goal of Lab3b is to light the LED when a button is pushed.

After setting up the two pins we need (one input, one output), the code enters 
an endless while loop where it checks the state of the push button and lights 
the LED if the button is pushed down.

Basic Steps:
- Cut/Paste previous project
- Delete/replace previous while loop
- Single-step code to observe behavior
- Run, to watch it work!

WARNING
Only lighting LED while "polling" the button is very inefficient!
We'll improve on this in the Interrupts lab exercise.
